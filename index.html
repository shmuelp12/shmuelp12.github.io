                    "Hacks/Tricks: Buying Delta points (user asks how to get 2-3k). El Al Dreamliner (787-9) has laptop plug (not just USB). El Al Protect (can add same calendar day as booking). El Al Lite ticket cancellation (no voucher protect, usually future flight credit). El Al voucher for sale (user asks for small amounts under $100). El Al voucher combination (can use multiple to pay for flight, can be used for anyone). El Al luggage transfer to Delta/Swiss Air (if on same itinerary, or if landing in USA then changing to Delta, self-transfer bags). El Al upgrade (set upgrade fees at check-in, depending on availability). El Al seat upgrade with Silver status (extra legroom for free, anything above unlikely). El Al ticket extension (user asks if can be avoided, try to turn into voucher and sell). El Al ticket name change (user asks about \"i\" instead of \"E\", needs to be changed before travel, TSA will give problems, El Al will issue gate pass if name very off). Users have inquired about experiences flying Arkia from NYC to Tel Aviv. Arkia check-in time (1 hour before, aim earlier). Arkia often changes schedule, moves departure time 5+ hours early. People happier with Arkia than Israir. Arkia contact: service@arkia.co.il (email), WhatsApp not good, phone hard to reach. Israir allows flight changes for a fee (user asks). Israir or Bluebird worse (both, Bluebird charges more for baggage). Emirates flight from Newark to Athens stopover (1 hr enough time? If stopover to Aegean, agent waits to escort. If self-transfer, recommend 2 hrs, if same ticket, fine). Emirates generally good with checking in bags to final destination. Booking same flight twice (airline cancelled both for one user). UA travel credit towards upgrade (user asks). UA flight booked economy with Alaska miles (user asks if possible to upgrade). United points for Copa (good deals). Copa gives free stopovers in Panama. Air Canada or Flying Blue cheaper for Panama. Air Canada having more access to Singapore awards then other Star Alliance partners (could be not phantom). JetBlue basic (will group family together with little kids). JetBlue delays (track incoming flight). Aegean Airlines from USA (phone: +1 833-732-8158). Aegean transfer to Emirates (user asks about 2 separate bookings). Qatar Airways (user asks about Jewish-wise issues, user flew, treated well, very nice airline, safe to wear kippa/bring tefillin). International stopover (2.5 hrs enough time for customs/baggage recheck with same airline? If not delayed, good)."

User says airlines don't offer much when weather related. User says it's an act of god, they won't give anything else.

North America

This section covers destinations across Canada, the United States, Central America, and the Caribbean. The information reflects a high concentration of travel within the US, particularly along the East Coast, with detailed discussions on kosher infrastructure.



Canada

Discussions on Canada often center on the well-traveled corridor of Montreal, Toronto, and Niagara Falls, suggesting that many visitors tour these cities within a single trip.



Montreal, QC

Kosher Restaurants & Food

Yakimono Sushi: Recommended as a place for "great sushi" (2019).   



Chops: A steakhouse mentioned as an option (2019).   



Chiyoko Sushi: Located at 2113 St Louis St, Saint Laurent. Described as "very good" with "top quality meats" (2019).

District Bagel: Mentioned as a bagel shop option (2019).   



Exceptions and Mozart: Listed as dairy options (2019).

Niagara Falls, ON (Canadian Side)

Minyan/Chabad

Chabad Niagara - Jewish Welcome Centre: Located at 6417 Main St, Niagara Falls, ON. It is noted they have a milchig (dairy) restaurant. It is recommended to call ahead to confirm minyanim as hours can be "interesting." Chabad also offers a discounted attraction package booklet that includes skip-the-line passes for many attractions (2017, 2018).   



Kosher Restaurants & Food

Chabad Restaurant: The Chabad houses a pizza shop and a sit-down fleishig (meat) place, with minyanim available, especially during the summer (2017).   



Bubbys Bagels: As of July 2018, this was mentioned as the only other kosher restaurant on the Canadian side. It operates under a Toronto hechsher and is not run by Chabad. They sell pizza (2018). The specific mention of a "Toronto hechsher" highlights a nuanced approach to evaluating kosher supervision, where the authority of a larger, more established community's certification is seen as a key factor for travelers.   



Things to Do & See

Maid of the Mist: An accessible attraction (2018).   



Journey Behind the Falls: An accessible attraction (2018).

Hockey Hall of Fame: A recommended museum (2019).   



Waterfront: The area near the CN Tower is nice for walking. It is accessible during a layover at Billy Bishop Airport (YTZ) via a tunnel to the city (2019).   



Costa Rica

Travel to Costa Rica prompted significant discussion, not about a lack of in-country options, but about the considerable uncertainty and risk associated with customs enforcement when attempting to bring personal kosher provisions.



Kosher Food & Customs

Chabad of Costa Rica: Offers kosher food, including meat, which can be picked up. They also provide catering services (2023).   



Private Chefs: A private trip planner with connections to kosher chefs who can prepare native-style food with a mashgiach was mentioned (2023).   



Bringing Meat into Costa Rica: This is a major point of discussion and reveals a spectrum of traveler experiences and risk tolerance.



One user reported a strict experience at Liberia Airport (LIR): "very strict about meat. All but deli and franks were taken away from us. Steak, burgers, chicken, were all thrown out by customs." They noted that all bags are put through an X-ray machine (2020).   



This was immediately countered with anecdotal workarounds, including one user suggesting "its nothing that a 20 inside the passport wont solve" and another sharing a "shtick" where a friend "put USDA stickers on everything" but was not stopped anyway (2020).   



The inconsistency of enforcement was summarized humorously: "They say the guy in front of you will have his cooked meat taken away and keep the raw meat, and the guy behind you will have his raw meat taken away and keep his cooked meat" (2020).   



This discourse indicates that travelers perceive the official rules as less predictable than the arbitrary nature of their enforcement on any given day. Planning a trip with personal meat provisions requires a high tolerance for risk or a reliable backup plan, such as ordering from the local Chabad.



Car Rentals

A user shared a detailed story about renting from Alamo. After their car window was smashed, they had to change their airport drop-off last minute from Liberia (LIR) to San Jose (SJO), a three-hour drive apart. The rental agent was very accommodating and "didn't charge a dime extra, not for the miles or the window," saving the user from dealing with insurance. This highlights the potential for flexibility and positive outcomes when communicating directly with local rental agents (2020).   



Cuba

Minyan/Chabad

There is no Chabad in Cuba (2023).   



The local rabbi's contact is adath@enet.cu (2023).   



There are "hardly anyone fully orthodox" (2023).   



Kosher Restaurants & Food

There is "nothing kosher" available (2023).   



Tour Guides & Drivers

An intercity driver recommendation was requested (2023).   



Things to Do & See

An itinerary is available here: https://www.evernote.com/l/AdmpZazwQ09JyY809RQktu6fXm3QJpg9i2s/ (2023).   



Dominican Republic

Kosher Food

Chabad: Food can be ordered from Chabad in Santo Domingo. One user picked up food there for a Shabbos stay. The food was described as "ait" (alright). The user suggested that if flying into Punta Cana or elsewhere, it might be better to bring your own food, as it may not be worth the additional shipping costs from Santo Domingo (2023).   



Bringing Meat In: A user reported a "bad experience" bringing meat into Punta Cana. They had all raw meat and chicken confiscated. However, "Hot dogs, burgers, and deli we were fine." Cooked items may be fine, potentially requiring a USDA label. All bags are scanned in Punta Cana (2024).   



Guatemala

Minyan/Chabad

Chabad Antigua: Contact information was shared for the Chabad in Antigua (2023).

Playa Del Carmen

Hotel Recommendations

Andaz Mayakoba vs. Grand Hyatt Playa Del Carmen: A detailed comparison was provided. The Andaz is described as "more spread out, quieter more relaxing" but requires a "good drive to food / minyan." The Grand Hyatt is "in playa," more central, has a kosher restaurant in the hotel, and is close to Chabad and other restaurants. The choice between them reflects a trade-off between a resort feel and kosher convenience (2023).

Other Info/Tips

Puerto Rico

San Juan

Minyan/Chabad

Turks and Caicos

Kosher Food

United States of America

The volume of information for the USA is extensive, reflecting the travel patterns of the group members. There is a clear distinction in the type of advice provided for different regions. East Coast destinations like New York and Miami feature rich, detailed discussions on specific restaurants and competing kashrus standards. In contrast, queries about the West Coast or more remote locations tend to focus on the basic availability of a Chabad, minyanim, and the logistics of bringing one's own food. This reflects both the demographic concentration of the chat members and the maturity of the kosher infrastructure across the country.



A recurring and significant undercurrent in the discussions is the concept of "kashrus reliability." The community demonstrates a sophisticated awareness, often questioning not just if a place is kosher, but who certifies it and whether that authority is trusted. This guide meticulously documents these kashrus-related discussions, as they represent a primary value for the intended reader.

Atlantic City, NJ (and Ventnor City)

Kosher Restaurants & Food

Jerusalem Glatt (Ventnor City): This meat restaurant, a 10-minute drive from AC, generated highly conflicting reviews. It was described as "barely a restaurant," an "alte farkakte expensive diner," and "super expensive and not such great food" with "pretty bad service" (2016). However, another user countered, "It's actually delicious food I was there 2 months ago. No complaints on taste," acknowledging the price was high but there was "no choice really" (2016). A user also advised to "Look in to hashgacha" (2016).   



Dairy Restaurant (next to Jerusalem Glatt): This was described as "much more fairly priced" and "really great" (2016).   



Bubbies Bistro / Pizza Palace: These were mentioned as kosher options in AC (2018). However, a later post stated that Bubbies had closed (2023). Another user mentioned Bubbies Bistro was open all year (2022). This highlights the changing nature of the kosher scene.   



Summer Meat Place: A user recalled a meat place that was open in the summer only (2023).   



Hotel Recommendations

Some suites in AC hotels have jacuzzis (2022).

Another user mentioned a Bnei Akiva camp (https://www.moshavaalevy.org/) and thought it might be possible to join their minyan if staying nearby, but was unsure of the logistics (2023).

Europe

Travel discussions for Europe reveal a "hub and spoke" model of kosher travel planning. Travelers frequently establish a base in a city with strong kosher infrastructure—a "hub" like Rome, Paris, Vienna, or Milan—and then make excursions to "spoke" locations with limited or no kosher options, such as the Amalfi Coast or much of Croatia. This logistical approach, which involves stocking up on provisions in a major center, is a key theme. The following table consolidates contact information for guides and drivers mentioned for various European cities, a valuable resource for planning.

Italy

Italy is a major destination for the group, with extensive discussions on Rome and Venice. A significant theme is the complexity of kashrus standards, with travelers advised to be diligent in their research. The Chief Rabbi of Milan's recommendation (as of 2018) for visitors not to eat meat in Rome underscores this point. The country exemplifies the "hub-and-spoke" travel model, where cities with robust kosher infrastructure like Rome and Milan serve as supply bases for trips to southern Italy or the Alps, where options are scarce.



General Information

Kosher Food Lists: The Italy Kosher Union provides a list of kosher products: http://www.italykosherunion.it/en/kosher-food-list/ (2016). However, it may be incomplete, and finding specific brands can be difficult (2016).   



Kashrus Contacts: Rabbi Hazan, the Chabad Rav of Milan, is a recommended contact for kashrus questions. His number is +39.02.29414170 (2016). KosherQuest.org is also mentioned as a resource, though one should consult their own Rabbi about relying on it (2016).   



Self-Provisioning: It is suggested that you can buy pre-packaged food, including fresh deli, from kosher stores in Rome, Venice, or Milan if traveling to areas with no kosher options (2016).   



Amalfi Coast / Naples / Sorrento / Positano

Kosher Food

There are no kosher restaurants south of Rome, including in Naples or on the Amalfi Coast (2022).   



Delivery from Rome is suggested as a possibility (2022).   



Things to Do & See

Naples: Opinions are divided. One user described it as "not a nice city very run down," recommending to "go to sorrento" instead (2022). Another countered that "if you like real raw history, naples is one of the richest cities in all of Italy," but requires a solid tour guide and car. Pompeii is very close by (2022).   



Sorrento: Recommended as a base for exploring the region via boat tours and ferries (2022). A user offered a "really nice b&b with private pool" for a specific night (2024).

Florence

Kosher Restaurants & Food

Ruth's: The only kosher place mentioned. It is an Israeli-style dairy restaurant with no gelato (2016).   



Kashrus Controversy: The hechsher at Ruth's was a subject of significant discussion. It is under the supervision of the Chief Rabbi of Florence. However, as of summer 2016, the local Chabad (located across the street) did not endorse it. Furthermore, a user reported that in summer 2014, the Chabad of Milan advised that Ruth's should be avoided (2016). This is a key example of the complex kashrus landscape travelers must navigate.   



Tour Guides & Drivers

Giovanna Rosenfeld: A recommended tour guide for Florence (2023).   



Lake Garda

For Shabbos, you must send your name and passport information in advance to be placed on an approved list for entry. An official in charge may chase people out for exploring during davening times (2024).

Things to Do & See

Trevi Fountain: It is free to visit and does not require tickets. It is "usually really crowded," so it is recommended to go "later at night if possible," as it is less crowded and "a lot nicer at night" (2023).

Gallery: A mid-range option (90 EU/pp as of 2018) with similar food to Gam Gam but served less luxuriously.



Gam Gam: The most expensive option (126 EU/pp as of 2018) but also the most "intimate," with the possibility of dining canal-side.

There was a discussion about ticketing: until 4 PM it's tickets only (which can be bought online on the spot, but risk being sold out), and after 4 PM it's walk-in only with a potential two-hour wait (2018).

For a short stop, a walk down La Rambla and a meal at Maccabi is suggested (2018). Another user disagreed, stating they "did all the hotspots in 9 hours," but stressed the need to "reserve tickets to EVERYTHING beforehand" (2018).

I understand. My previous update was insufficient. I will now perform a comprehensive update to your "Interactive Kosher Travel Guide" by meticulously extracting and integrating all the relevant information from the new document you have provided, "A Compendium of Global Kosher Travel Intelligence."

This update will be significantly more thorough and will include:

Adding details from every relevant entry in the new document.
Creating new entries for cities and countries not previously in your guide.
Including the year of each data point for context, as specified in the document.
Incorporating the nuanced discussions on kashrus, conflicting reviews, and specific recommendations.
Adding the contact information for tour guides and drivers to their respective cities.
The result will be a much larger and more detailed travelDataStore, transforming your guide into a far more valuable resource.
